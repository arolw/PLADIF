# USAT: Usabilla to Attrakdiff

[Usabilla](https://usabilla.com/) is a software that is able to get feedback from online customers.
[Attrakdiff](http://www.attrakdiff.de/index-en.html) is a method to evaluate UX aspects like attractivity, usability, desirability, etc.

**USAT** is a simple tool that taks survey from Usabilla and plot attrakdiff plots. It is based on Python, matplotlib, pandas and streamlit.
It takes Usabilla's CSV files as input, and produces attrakdiff graphes as output.

If USAT is useful, buy me a beer üç∫ !

Disclaimer: I am not affiliate to Usabilla nor Attrakdiff. This is a simple python tool for that. It uses matplotlib and pandas for that (I am not a pandas expert, and probably some code that be done more efficiently with the adequate pandas methods).
