# USAT: Usabilla to Attrakdiff

[Usabilla](https://usabilla.com/) is a software that is able to get feedback from online customers.
[Attrakdiff](http://www.attrakdiff.de/index-en.html) is a method to evaluate UX aspects like attractivity, usability, desirability, etc.

This is a simple tool that taks survey from Usabilla and plot attrakdiff plots.

Disclaimer: I am not affiliate to Usabilla nor Attrakdiff. This is a simple python tool for that. It uses matplotlib and pandas for that (I am not a pandas expert, and probably some of the code that be done more efficiently with the adequate pandas methods).
